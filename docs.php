          <h3>Documentation</h3><br />

          <p>It's a fact that one of the biggest problems with today's software is lack of good documentation, or any
          documentation for that matter. Programmers generally don't have a lot of time to document their work, and the things
          they do document are usually oriented towards other programmers. While we can appreciate the programmers point of view,
          we feel it's necessary to cater to a larger audience (i.e our users) by providing clear, concise information on how to
          use our software. The sections below will bring all of these pieces of information together for you.</p>

          <p>Before you get started with Window Maker, you need to have an understanding of how to make use of the documentation
          that comes with the source distribution. The main objective to using documentation is to <strong>understand</strong>
          it, which coincidentally requires that you <strong>read</strong> it. A common mistake is for new or novice users to
          overlook this information, leading them to frustration and a bad first impression. Please take a moment to peruse the
          sections below, which should make the experience of learning Window Maker a more pleasant one.</p>
