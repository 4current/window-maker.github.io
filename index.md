Introduction
============

**Window Maker** is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide
integration support for the [GNUstep](http://gnustep.org) Desktop Environment.
In every way possible, it reproduces the elegant look and feel of the
[NEXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP) user interface. It is fast,
feature rich, easy to configure, and easy to use. It is also free software,
with contributions being made by programmers from around the world.

Window Maker has a stable user interface since many years and comes with a
powerful GUI configuration editor called WPrefs, which removes the need to edit
text-based config files by hand. It supports running
[dockapps](https://www.dockapps.net) which make everyday tasks such as
monitoring system performance and battery usage, mounting devices or connecting
to the internet very easy. Please see the [features](features.html) section for
more specifics on what Window Maker can do, and how it compares with other
popular window managers.
