Introduction
============

**Window Maker** is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide
integration support for the [GNUstep](http://gnustep.org) Desktop Environment,
although it can run stand alone. In every way possible, it reproduces the
elegant look and feel of the [NEXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP)
user interface.
