Etiquette
---------

The following rules of etiquette are to be followed when posting to any of the
lists:

* Do not [top post](http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html).
* Use of excessive quoting in E-mail replies is frowned upon.
* HTML messages and non-text attachments will be rejected.
* Please consider reading some of our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs)
  before posting questions to the lists.  The Window Maker source code comes
  with a README, INSTALL, and NEWS file. There is also a
  [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/FAQ.html) to read.
* Please, please, and pretty please **THINK** before you post. Try very hard not
  to intentionally provoke others and cause flame-wars. We reserve the right to
  unsubscribe and ban any user that has a history of causing trouble.
