          <p><strong>Window Maker</strong> is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide integration support for the
          <a href="http://gnustep.org">GNUstep</a> Desktop Environment. In every way possible, it reproduces the elegant look and
          feel of the NEXTSTEP user interface. It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure, and easy to use. It is also free
          software, with contributions being made by programmers from around the world.</p>

          <p>Window Maker includes compatibility options which allow it to work with other popular desktop environments, namely
          GNOME and KDE, and comes with a powerful GUI configuration editor, called WPrefs, which removes the need to edit
          text-based config files by hand. It also supports running <a href="http://dockapps.windowmaker.org">dockapps</a> which
          help on tasks such as monitoring system performance and battery usage, mounting devices or connecting to the internet
          etc. Please see the features section for more specifics on what Window Maker can do, and how it compares with other
          popular window managers.</p>
